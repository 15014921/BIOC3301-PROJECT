# BIOC3301-PROJECT

### After 'preparing sequences', the seqs.fna file underwent open, closed and de novo picking followed by core diversity analysis, alpha diversity analysis and taxa summaries.

### After analysis, comparisons were made, using the script in 'comparisons' and repeated:
### Firstly on taxa levels 2-6 for whole taxa
### Secondly on taxa levels 2-6 for core microbiome
